仁 (Pinyin: Rén) is the highest virtue in Confucianism. The character translates to 'benevolence' or 'co-humanity' and in Confucianism is the general Foundation for Behavior. [^1]
In Confucian ethics, ren underpins personal morality and the broader social order. It is the basis of all other virtues: respect, righteousness, sincerity, etc. Confucius taught that one practices ren initially at home through xiao (filial piety) and then extends it outward: love of parents and family expands to love of society and humanity​.[^2]

Yan Hui, one of the Four Sages, once asked his master to describe the rules of ren. Confucius replied, "One should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper."
In Confucian ethics, ren underpins personal morality and the broader social order.
