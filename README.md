Hanzi Lanterns is a blog about Chinese culture, characters and history.

This blog is not operated by a team, but rather a single person.

I try my best to take my information from reliable resources, such as [Chineasy](https://www.chineasy.com) and the [corresponding books](https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/shaolan-20162122537947).
